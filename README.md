Quick Notes:
I made this project as a quickly configurable engine to output randomized text files of words that have certain characteristics for typing practice.
The input is the generic UNIX dictionary, and some examples of outputs are words with Q or P (which I practice because I tend to use my ring finger instead of my pinky finger).
There are also outputs for words mostly typed with characters on the left or right side of the keyboard, which I've noticed slow me down often.
